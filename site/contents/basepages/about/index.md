#Hey you

Hi I'm Ana Beatriz, Java fullstack developer, I am currently a Software Engineer at Itaú Bank from Brazil

I'm really curious, always wanting to learn new things (this blog is proof of that). I like and get along with Java, but I really enjoy venturing into infra, linux and also the front end. In addition to being a developer I'm a technology speaker and I go around coordinating theSou Java, Womakerscode and Unicorntech communities.

I love to learn and I love to teach, when I'm not working I'm writing some article, or producing some content for the community! You see my articles already published on Dev.to, and follow the most recent ones right here :)
