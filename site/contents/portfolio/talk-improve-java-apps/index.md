In the world of development it becomes increasingly necessary work optimizations, ides came to help us in this process, imagine only if everything was done in notepad the time it would cost us!
IntelliJ is a platform coming from jetbrains that helps us a lot, both in shortcuts and in their property settings, in this talk we will see what the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) has to do with this, some interesting shortcuts, and how optimized code facilitates all this.
We'll also see some optimizations that kotlin brings us into some parts of the code!
